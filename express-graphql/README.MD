Leaning GraphQL by building APIs using Node.js and Express-GraphQL for books and authors.
- By Web Dev Simplified

Using authors and books list instead of connecting with database.

```
authors = [
	{ id: 1, name: 'J. K. Rowling' },
	{ id: 2, name: 'J. R. R. Tolkien' },
	{ id: 3, name: 'Brent Weeks' }
]

books = [
	{ id: 1, name: 'Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets', authorId: 1 },
	{ id: 2, name: 'Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban', authorId: 1 },
	{ id: 3, name: 'Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire', authorId: 1 },
	{ id: 4, name: 'The Fellowship of the Ring', authorId: 2 },
	{ id: 5, name: 'The Two Towers', authorId: 2 },
	{ id: 6, name: 'The Return of the King', authorId: 2 },
	{ id: 7, name: 'The Way of Shadows', authorId: 3 },
	{ id: 8, name: 'Beyond the Shadows', authorId: 3 }
]
```

We have a `books` table which has foreign key for the authors `table`
