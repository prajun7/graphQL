  Creating BookType

   - fields is used to define what the BookType returns and it should be a function which returns an object
   - fileds is a funciton which is returning an object including books' information like id, name and authorId

  fields: () => ({
    ...
  }), 
  Here fields is returning a function instaed of an actualy object.
  It is returning a function that retuns an object.
  And the reason we are returning a function that returns an object instead of returning just an object is,
  that BookType references AuthorType, that is we need AuthorType to be defined before BookType.
  Also, if we look at AuthorType, we can see that AuthorType references BookType.
  So, both the BookType and AuthorType depend on each other.
  If we just return an object from the fields, we will get AuthorType is not defined or BookType is not defined error
  So, that we need to return a function, so that everything can get defined before they actually getting called.
